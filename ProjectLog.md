- started logging project progress
- still working on angular web app I've managed to get the app working correctly but still having trouble serving the app through node. I'm going to do a bit more looking into how node and express works

- I'm moving away from angular and the MEAN stack idea for my web app and instead I'm going to use react. react is more popular at the moment for single page web apps and its prefect for a beginner like me I'm using the [official react website][l1]
- working on react web app. amking progress added main page and title bar, its going well react is much easier to use than angular.
