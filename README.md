## [Project Log](ProjectLog.md)

Falls among the elderly is a serious issue. And to help reduce the effects of a bad fall it is imperative that help comes as soon as possible. That is the point of my project, to develop a device that is able to detect a serious fall and alert next of kin, emergency services, care workers or any other people added to the devices internal call list.
