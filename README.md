Falls among the elderly are a serious issue. And to help reduce the affects of a bad fall its in imperative that help comes as soon as possible. That is the point of my project, to develop a device that is able to detect a serious fall and alert next of kin, emergency services, care workers or any other people added to the devices internal call list.
